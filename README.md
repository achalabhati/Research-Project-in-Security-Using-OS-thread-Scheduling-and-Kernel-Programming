# Research-Project-in-Security-Using-OS-thread-Scheduling-and-Kernel-Programming : 
- This is a cache based side channel attack.
- Worked on deducing private key for ECDSA, DSA using cached based side channel attack using kernel Programming
and thread scheduling.
- The attack has been performed on different environment single core processor, multicore processor, i3 processor, i5 processor
with background process and without back ground process, Using single cache line or mulitple cache line.
